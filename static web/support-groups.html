                What are substance abuse support groups?
            </h2>
            <h4>
                <p style="justify-content: baseline;">
                    Substance abuse support groups are gatherings of individuals who come together to provide mutual assistance, encouragement, and guidance to those struggling with substance abuse issues. These groups typically consist of people who are in recovery themselves, as well as trained facilitators or counselors. The primary purpose of substance abuse support groups is to offer a safe and non-judgmental environment where individuals can share their experiences, seek advice, receive emotional support, and learn coping strategies to manage their addiction. Examples of well-known substance abuse support groups include Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narcotics Anonymous (NA), and SMART Recovery. These groups often follow a structured format, including group discussions, sharing sessions, and adherence to a set of guiding principles or steps aimed at promoting recovery and sobriety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’re trying to give up drugs, peer support groups, also known as recovery support or mutual self-help groups, can be an invaluable source of guidance, assistance, and encouragement. Peer support groups are regular gatherings of people trying to overcome a substance abuse issue. These groups either meet online or in person, and group discussion is usually led by a facilitator who also has experience with addiction.

                <h2>1. Narcotic Anonymous (NA)</h2>
                <p>
                    Narcotics Anonymous or NA is the most well-known and widely available recovery support group for drug abuse and addiction. Unlike Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), which is limited to alcohol problems, Narcotics Anonymous is open to substance abuse problems of all kinds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NA uses fellowship and a set of guided principles—the 12 steps—to help members achieve and maintain sobriety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 12-step process includes:
                </p>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li>Admitting that you are powerless to control your addiction or compulsion.</li>
                        <li>Recognizing a higher power “as you understand it” that can give strength.</li>
                        <li>Reviewing the mistakes you’ve made in the past, with the help of your sponsor.</li>
                        <li>Making amends for past mistakes and wrongs.</li>
                        <li>Learning how to live a new life, free from old unhealthy habits and ways of behaving.</li>
                        <li>Helping fellow drug abusers or addicts.</li>

                    </ul>
                
                <p>
                    A key part of a 12-step program is choosing a sponsor. A sponsor is a former addict who has time and experience remaining sober and can provide support when you’re dealing with the urge to use. Research shows that having a sponsor seems to help a person maintain long-term abstinence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NA members attend group meetings facilitated by other members—all recovering drug abusers. Meetings take place on a regular basis, at various times, and in many different locations around the world. They’re typically held in community spaces, such as churches, but online meetings are also available. Members are free to attend any of the many meetings held each week.
                </p>

                    <h3>
                        Benefits and limitations
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Many people who join NA recovery support groups enjoy the wide availability of sessions, as well as the opportunities to connect with others. The structure of NA can be especially useful for beginners. For example, it’s possible to start with this 12-step program and then begin to incorporate other approaches to create a hybrid treatment plan that works for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are some potential drawbacks, however. Some people don’t agree with the philosophical aspects of NA, such as labeling oneself an addict, committing to total abstinence, or turning to a “higher power” for strength. Others simply feel that the meetings are too unstructured, allowing one person to dominate the conversation. Some also feel unable to venture into certain topics, such as psychiatric medications, during these group sessions.

                <h2>2. Dual Recovery Anonymous (DRA)</h2>
                <p>
                    Like NA, Dual Recovery Anonymous is a 12-step group, and those individual steps are the same. However, the organization addresses both substance abuse problems and co-occurring mental health disorders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Co-occurring disorders, also referred to as dual diagnosis, is a term used when you have both a mental health disorder—such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder—and a drug or alcohol problem. Both the mental health issue and the addiction have their own unique symptoms that may get in the way of your ability to function, handle life’s difficulties, and relate to others. Whether your mental health issue or addiction came first, recovery depends on treating both problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To join DRA, you must have a desire to stop using drugs as well as manage your psychiatric issues in a healthy way. In online and in-person meetings, DRA members share their stories, support one another, and develop recovery tools that protect against relapse. Although the group may be more comfortable than NA for those who want to dive into discussions about mental health, DRA meetings aren’t as widely available.

                <h2>3. Secular Organizations for Sobriety (SOS)</h2>
                <p>
                    Secular Organizations for Sobriety (SOS) is an international organization that takes a science-based, self-empowerment approach to abstinence and recovery from substance addiction. The organization believes that sobriety is a separate issue from religion or spirituality. It credits the individual for achieving and maintaining their own sobriety without reliance on any higher power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SOS members aim to establish a cycle of sobriety. The cycle involves acknowledging the substance use disorder, accepting the disorder, and then prioritizing sobriety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each SOS group is autonomous, and the format of the sessions is determined by the members. However, the groups all strive to provide peer support and offer a nonreligious space where members can express their thoughts about their recovery.

                <h2>4. SMART Recovery (Self-Management and Recovery Training)</h2>
                <p>
                    SMART Recovery is a program that aims for abstinence through self-empowerment and self-directed change. The organization follows a four-point program that involves the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Build the motivation to pursue change.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Learn to cope with the urge to use drugs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Manage your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors without turning to addictive substances.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Develop habits that lead to a balanced, healthy life.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    SMART Recovery members participate in online or in-person meetings that are facilitated by trained volunteers or professionals. Structured group discussions give participants an opportunity to share their experiences and exchange feedback. Tools, such as worksheets, and group exercises, such as role-playing, help participants find actionable solutions and build recovery plans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SMART Recovery doesn’t include sponsors and deemphasizes the role of spirituality. You might find that sessions are more focused on psychoeducation and implementing CBT techniques than social support. Some participants of SMART Recovery sessions also report that the pacing of sessions can be slow and repetitive. However, the results of a 2019 study suggest that SMART might be as effective as 12-step groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The organization offers more than 2,000 mutual self-help groups in the U.S. and abroad. You can choose from online and in-person meetings, but the availability of meetings doesn’t match that of NA.
